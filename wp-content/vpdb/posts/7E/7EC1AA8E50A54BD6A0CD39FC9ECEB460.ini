Come to Lasalle Park this Sunday at 9:30 pm. Pyromancy and any fire performers are having a meet and greet to practice, play and talk. There will be a casual Fire Eating instructional as well as a Safety Training.

Photographers are welcomed! Please take photos of us and submit them to the Pyromancy website. This is a great opportunity to expand your art with some interesting subjects.

We usually reside by the Amphitheater by the river. See you there!"
