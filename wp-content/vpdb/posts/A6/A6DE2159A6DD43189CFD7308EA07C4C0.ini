Pyromancy will be busking on Main Street this Friday for the kick off to the \"legitimate\" theater season!  Come see us next to the Bijou Grill, just look for the torches.  We'll be doing shows once an hour or so between 5 and 8, then heading over to The VAuLT for another show just for them, then hitting the streets again at 10pm till when ever people go home!  There's going to be tons of great music, artists, vendors, and food, Curtain Up! one of the better parties of the year, hope to see you there.

AND Thursday night, 7:30pm Channel 4 WIVB will be showing a preview of whats lined up for the night, so be sure to catch that if you have any doubts as if you'll be coming.
