While the Allentown Art Festival is currently in full swing, the folks down in the old First Ward are preparing for next weekend's mighty river festival appropriately called Buffalo River Fest. I've attended this festival for years now, and can honestly say that there is nothing else like it around. While the Riverfest Regatta is a big draw for both contestants and onlookers alike, there are so many other fun-filled events and activities taking place throughout the course of the weekend.

The Valley Community Center does a spectacular job each year... and while the past eleven years have been action packed with tons of family fun, this year is looking like it will be the best yet. Why? Because Riverfest is, for the second season, showing off its new home at Buffalo River Fest Park located at 249 Ohio Street, Buffalo, NY, near Michigan Avenue. New to this year's festival will be Buffalo Scholastic Rowing Club Races (see latest news of the boathouse to be built). Now that the festival is located so close to the rowing club, it's a natural fit for coinciding races... hopefully we'll see the numbers of rowers and spectators grow each and every year. Also, don't pass up the chance to take a ride on Buffalo's historic EM Cotter Fireboat -the oldest operating fireboat in the world!

If you're tired of going to the same festivals year after year, you need to expand your horizons and get down to the Buffalo River next weekend. The festival is situated directly in-between the Inner and Outer Harbors, which means that you can spend more time exploring new waterfront parks, restaurants, bike trails, boardwalks... you can even check out the massive grain silos, Mutual Riverfront Park, The Swannie House, McCarthy's Irish Pub... there's so much to see and do that one weekend is just not enough!

Here are all of the details!!!

The Valley Community Association's 12th Annual \"Buffalo River Fest\" is scheduled for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, June 15th - 17th, 2012. The event will be held from 6pm to Midnight on Friday, from 11am to Midnight on Saturday, and Noon to 6pm on Sunday at Buffalo River Fest Park.
